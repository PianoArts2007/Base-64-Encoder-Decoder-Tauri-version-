# Base-64-encoder-decoder-desktop-version Built in Tauri
 After I found out tauri I decided to port the full source code from electron to tauri because electron uses way too many resources and it takes a lot of space because of them.
 
 To get started with the source code you have to make sure that you have rust installed and the C++ build tools too.
 
 To run : `npm run tauri dev`
 
 To build: `npm run tauri build` but not before changing the identifier (in tauri.conf.json at line 24) from dev to build


 Fun Fact: the binary was built on my Raspberry Pi
